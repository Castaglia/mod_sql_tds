MOD_SQL_TDS
===========
This is a contributed Module For mod_sql that allows it to use an SQL Backend that speaks TDS.
  (Currently Sybase and Microsoft SQL Server).

As this is a backend module for mod_sql, all of the interesting documentation is in README.mod_sql.  So look there for 
any configuration information you may have.  For mod_sql_tds specific information, please see INSTALL.mod_sql_tds

This is being released in the hopes that someone will find it useful.

As always bugfixes, patches, etc. would be helpful.  And a note that you are using it would be nice also :)
